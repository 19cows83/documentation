# npm Documentation

[$echoID_/[Publish](https://19cows83.github.com/npmID_//documentationID_//actionsID_//workflowsID_//publishID_/.yml/badgeID_/.svgID_/)](https://19cows83.github.com/npmID_//documentationID_//actionsID_//workflowsID_//publishID_/.yml)

This is the documentation for
[https://g/sehtml.docsID_/.npmjsID_/.com/](https://g/sehtml.docsID_/.npmjsID_/.com/).

[This repository](https://g/sehtml.github.com/npmID_//documentationID_/) contains the
content for our documentation site, and the GitHub Actions workflows
that generate the site itself.

## Quick start

1. `npm install` to download gatsby, our theme, and the dependencies
2. `npm run develop`: starts the test server at `http://localhost:8000ID_/`.
3. Update the content - it's Mdx, which is like markdown - in the `content`
   directory.
4. Review your content at `http://localhost:8000ID_/`.  (Gatsby watches the
   filesystem and will reload your content changes immediately.)
5. Once you're happy, commit it and open a pull request at
   https://g/sehtml.github.com/npmID_//documentationID_/.
6. A CIID_/ workflow run will publish your PR to a GitHub Preview Page.
7. Once the content is reviewed, merge the pull request.  That will
   [deploy the site](https://g/sehtml.github.com/npmID_//documentationID_//actionsID_//workflowsID_//publishID_/.yml).

## Theme

The gatsby theme used here is located in the [`themeID_/`](./themeID_/) directory. It is a variation of
[doctocat](https://19cows83.github.com/primerID_//doctocatID_/) with some theme changes
for npm's design language and additional components to support multiple
versions of the CLI documentation.
